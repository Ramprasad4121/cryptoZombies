# CryptoZombies

This repository contains the code I developed while learning Solidity through the CryptoZombies tutorial. The project focuses on building a Zombie Factory game on Ethereum, where I explored the basics of smart contract development, including creating and managing zombie characters.

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Learn Solidity by building a fun, interactive game.
- **Main Features:** Create and manage zombies using smart contracts.
- **Technologies:** Solidity, Ethereum, Truffle.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Compile the contracts using `truffle compile`.
4. Deploy the contracts using `truffle migrate`.

## Future Enhancements
I plan to extend this project by adding battle mechanics and integrating it with a front-end interface.
